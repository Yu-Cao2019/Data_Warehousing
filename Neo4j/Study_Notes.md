## Graph Databases

### What is a Graph
Graph is a bastract, mathematical representation of two or more entities, showing relations between objects.

It made up of two components -- the nodes and the edges.

### What is a Graph Databases
Graph database is used to model data in a form of graph. It stores data using nodes, relationships and properties.

### Advantage of Graph Databases
- In RDBMS, performance suffers as the number and depth of relationships increases. 
However, in graph databases, performance remains high even if the amount of data grws significantly.
- Graph databases are schema-free, making them can add nodes, labels, subgraphs at any point.
- Graph databases are agility. They envolve data model with the rest of application.

### Comparing Graph Databases vs. RDBMS
|Graph Database|RDBMS|
|--------------|-----|
|Data is stored in graphs|Data is stored in tables|
|Nodes|Rows|
|Properties and their values|Columns and data|
|Connected nodes are defined by relationships|Constraints are used for relationships|
|Database traversal|Table joins|
