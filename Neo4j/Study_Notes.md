## Graph Databases

### What is a Graph
Graph is a bastract, mathematical representation of two or more entities, showing relations between objects.

It made up of two components -- the nodes and the edges.

### What is a Graph Databases
Graph database is used to model data in a form of graph. It stores data using nodes, relationships and properties.

### Advantage of Graph Databases
- In RDBMS, performance suffers as the number and depth of relationships increases. 
However, in graph databases, performance remains high even if the amount of data grws significantly.
- Graph databases are schema-free, making them can add nodes, labels, subgraphs at any point.
- Graph databases are agility. They envolve data model with the rest of application.

### Comparing Graph Databases vs. RDBMS
|Graph Database|RDBMS|
|--------------|-----|
|Data is stored in graphs|Data is stored in tables|
|Nodes|Rows|
|Properties and their values|Columns and data|
|Connected nodes are defined by relationships|Constraints are used for relationships|
|Database traversal|Table joins|

### Two Main Properties of Graph Databases
- Some graoh databases use 'native' graph storage specifically designed to store and manage graphs and others use relational or object-oriented databases. (Neo4j is a native graph database that is structured for native graph storage)
- Graph databases are index-free adjacency, indicating that native graph processing is the most efficient way to process data. The connected nodes point to each other in the database.

#### Native vs. Non-Native
Non-native graph is persistence layer and the data will grow. It need more hardware to solve the problem, and lower latencies for larger graphs. Native graph has scaling advantage and it store, query and traverse large interconnected datasets in real-time.

### Graph Databases Terminology
- Vertex/Node: an entity marked with a unique identifier analogous to primary key in a relational database.
- Edge: represents a relationship. Also known as a link or arc, an edge defines relationship between vertices or objects connecting vertices.
- Path: A set of vertices, along with the edges between those vertices. The vertices in a graph are all different from each other. If edges are directed, the path is a directed path. If the graph is undirected, the paths in it are undirected paths.
- Loop: Edge that connects vertex to itself.

#### Operations on Graphs
Insert, Read, Update, Delete data, Union of graphs, intersevtion of graphs, traversal of graph.

### When to Use Graph Databases
- Fraud detection: Fraudsters are using stolen identities to form fraud rings so graph database looks beyond individual data points to the actual connections that link them to see the patterns.
- Social networks: Socialrecommendations,Friend-of-Friendrecommendations.
- Identity and access management: Manage multiple changing roles, groups, products and access authorization and inheritances.
- Master data management: Master data, such as organizational and product data, has deep hierarchies with top-down, lateral and diagonal connections.
- Network and IT operations.

Donâ€™t use graph databases for the first time on something mission-critical
Graph database like Neo4j is not a general purpose database. It works well with specific use cases such as where the relationship is as (or more) important as the entities that it connects.
